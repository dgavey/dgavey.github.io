                <p><p>Dear Family, Friends and Foes</p>

<p>2024 had a significant amount of events in what I think is our quiet little life.  It turns out, it’s not as quiet as it seems.</p>

<p>January saw the local folk fest happening.  For the first time in a number of years I performed at the Singer/Songwriter night. It was a lot of fun as usual, and some saw some great performers as well.  I thought this would inspire me to do a bit more song writing and playing this year, but unfortunately that just wasn’t something I got back into. Who knows what 2025 will bring.</p>

<p>In February, Alex and I saw Feist in concert at the Palace Theater in Calgary.  That was just a fantastic show, so glad we got to experience that together.  Also Alex was in the high school musical production of Mean Girls around that time. In March Alex turned 20 and he also won an award from the <a href="https://www.clra.ca/">CLRA</a>.  He got to attend the CLRA conference in Edmonton for free and I got to go to the awards dinner with him to see him accept his prize.</p>

<p>By April, Alex was done his second year of college and graduated with his diploma in Environmental Biology and Land Reclamation. The ceremony for which was held in June.  He did very well in that program and made some great friends and contacts.</p>

<p>Speaking of graduating, one of the biggest events of the year was Georgia’s high school graduation.  She did extremely well in all of high school in general.  We just recently found out that she had tied for 3 highest mark overall in her graduating year.  Her school average well over 90%. June was a very busy month for us, as was all of the time leading up to it.</p>

<p>However before June was May where Georgia turned 18 and took a trip with her Nana (Isabelle) to Quebec.  She spent almost a week visiting with her great aunts and long lost cousins.  She had a great time and is looking forward to hopefully going back again soon.</p>

<p>I didn’t do too much hiking this summer, but Alex and I did manage to get one really fantastic hike to Alderton lake in Waterton.  It was very memorable.  Hoping to get back and do that one again.</p>

<p>I was fairly burnt out by work at the end of June and I decided to work short weeks all summer. The last 2 weeks of August Georgia, Joleen and I went to Hawaii and spent a week in Honolulu. The time spent in the city was great, but unfortunately we didn’t have great travel luck in general. Westjet was having major travel issues in August stemming from a massive hail storm earlier that month.  We ended up having a very stressful travel day to get to Hawaii with times where we were not sure we would even get there at all.</p>

<p>Then while there Georgia contracted Covid (though we didn’t know that’s what it was at the time) which put a damper on things a bit.  Then I started coming down with it on our last day there.  Traveling back was very difficult, we were all sick and we stayed up 36 hours to travel home. The trip had a lot of memorable moments, but it also scared us off more air travel at least for a while.</p>

<p>After we came back there was more busy times in store for us.  Alex had just finished his summer job with the Police Point Interpretive center and was ready to move to Lethbridge to go to UofL to finish his degree in Biology.  Moving in went well as did his first semester of school.  He ended the semester with a 3.8 GPA and learned a lot about living on his own on campus. He even started a radio program at the university station <a href="https://ckxu.com/">CKXU</a> You can listen to his folk program on Sundays at 8am. He also bought a standup bass this year and has been enjoying exploring that instrument more.</p>

<p>Georgia started post secondary at MHC and had a great first semester as well, finishing with a 4.0 GPA.  She is in a STEM based university transfer course with the intention of going to UofA in 2026 for laboratory science.</p>

<p>Leo (the dog) turned 11 years old this year!  Which is just great for a Golder Retriever.  He also had a wonderful year and wants you to know that he loves you and misses you.</p>

<p>Until next year, be well.</p>
