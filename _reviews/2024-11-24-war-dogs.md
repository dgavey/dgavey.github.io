"War Dogs" is a dramedy starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller. 

Based on a true story, it follows a massage therapist's transformation into an international arms dealer during the early 2000s and Gulf War era. 

Though billed as a dark comedy, I found the movie was more drama than comedyâ€”and not particularly dark. It manages to be quite funny when it wants to be, even inspiring catchphrases like "fifty-fifty." 

This was a truly interesting story and quite an enjoyable ride.
