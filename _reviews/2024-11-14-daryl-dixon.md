"The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon" seasons one and two proved to be a compelling binge-watch for us. The series follows Daryl, who washes ashore in France after the events of the original "Walking Dead" series.

As devoted fans of the original show, we've sampled other spin-offs but found most of them lacking. However, this one stands out. Setting the story in France was an inspired choice, introducing fresh faces to love and hate, breathing new life into the franchise.

For fans of "The Walking Dead," this spin-off earns a solid thumbs up, offering a welcome addition to the franchise.
