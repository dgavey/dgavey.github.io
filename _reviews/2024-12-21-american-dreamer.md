"American Dreamer" follows a disillusioned college professor pursuing the American Dream of owning a large house, only to get something unexpected instead.

Starring Peter Dinklage and Shirley MacLaine, this movie is a delight. The pacing is excellent, and the story remains engaging throughout. The quotes at the beginning of each chapter of the professor's writing add a thoughtful layer to the narrative. Even the minor characters are well-developed and memorable.

This film deserves much wider recognition.
