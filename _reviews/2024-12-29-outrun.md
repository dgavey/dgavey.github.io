"The Outrun" starring Saoirse Ronan is the story of a person struggling with alcoholism and finding themselves again back home.

This sad and beautiful movie is set mostly in the Orkney islands off Scotland, where stunning cinematography and natural landscapes provide a backdrop for slowly revealing the main character's backstory. Though artfully paced, Saoirse's stunning performance ensures it never feels dull.

Highly recommend for anyone interested in film festival-style movies.
