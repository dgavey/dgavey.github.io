"My Old Ass" is a teenage coming-of-age story starring Maisy Stella and Aubrey Plaza on Amazon Prime. It tells the story of a young woman who comes into contact with her future self.

This well-crafted comedy delivers strong LGBTQ representation throughout. Despite its indie film roots, the cinematography is impressive. I particularly appreciated its Canadian setting, complemented by an all-Canadian soundtrack featuring artists like Feist, Andy Shauf, and CÅ“ur de Pirate.

Filmed in Ontario's Muskoka Lakes region on a cranberry farm, the movie's environmental shots are enough to justify watching even if the story wasn't. The location's natural beauty makes me want to add it to my travel list soon.

Overall, it's a solid coming-of-age story that achieves genuine emotional depth.
