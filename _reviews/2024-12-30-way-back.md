"The Way Back" (2011) tells the story of a group of people who walked out of a Siberian gulag to freedom. 

Based on real events and a book whose authenticity is somewhat in question, this was a great film to watch. The makeup in particular was incredible. As usual, Colin Farrell and Ed Harris were great to watch, but also a surprise appearance by a very young Saoirse Ronan was very well acted. 

Although overlooked by me at the time, glad I had a chance to watch it 13 years later.
