"Lovelace" is a biopic about the first porn superstar Linda Lovelace, based on her memoirs. 

This 2013 film starring Amanda Seyfried was surprisingly good, given that the reviews on this movie were quite terrible. The acting was particularly good from both Amanda and her co-star Peter Skarsg√•rd. Sharon Stone as the mother was unrecognizable and also delivered a great performance. The writers used an interesting technique of replaying similar scenes from different perspectives after you learn new information. The sexual content wasn't too explicit given the context of the movie, which I thought was a good choice. 

Quite a good movie overall.
