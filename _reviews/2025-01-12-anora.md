Anora is a modern-day Cinderella story, but with a few twists.

This film festival darling is one we've been wanting to watch for a while, and it was worth the wait. The basic plot is that a NYC sex worker gets swept off her feet by the son of a Russian oligarch. It's probably better if you don't know more than that going into it. The movie was a lot funnier than I expected, and the ending wasnâ€™t quite what I anticipated, but I appreciated where they went with it.

A really great indie film that deserves all the attention it's getting.
