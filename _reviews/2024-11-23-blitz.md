"Blitz" is a movie on Apple TV+ starring Saoirse Ronan about a group of Londoners during WWII.

Ultimately a story of a mother and her son separated during the Blitz, the film does a good job of exposing social issues of the era. I learned several things about that time in history I wasn't aware of.

The film is solid but not exceptional. It made some odd choices with visuals and audio that were supposed to be artistic, but they felt more like distractions.

Saoirse, as usual, was engaging to watch, though most of the supporting actors didn't have a chance to tell their stories. It felt in the end like there was missing content.
