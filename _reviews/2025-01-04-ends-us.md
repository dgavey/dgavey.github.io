"It Ends With Us" is a story about a woman in an abusive relationship and the cycle of abuse. 

Based on a Colleen Hoover novel, this movie stars Blake Lively. There has been controversy surrounding the film since its release, with several ongoing lawsuits casting shadows over both the stars and director. While the film was adequate, it struggled to tell a realistic story and glossed over the darker aspects of this societal issue. That being said, several of the supporting characters were exceptionally well-acted, particularly those who played the younger versions of the main characters.

Overall this movie was entertaining, but I was hoping for something more from it than what I got.
