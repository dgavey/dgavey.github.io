The Substance is a film festival satirical horror starring Demi Moore

This film is up for a number of Oscars and won 4 Golden Globes.  I'm honestly surprised it's been winning awards.  The movie itself is fantastic, well shot, well edited, great story, great special effects.  I'm surprised because it reminds me so much of 80's B horror movie in style and that kind of movie usually gets overlooked by movie critics.

This movie is truly horrific and I don't recommend for the average movie goer, but if you're a fan of 80's horror I think you'll love it.
