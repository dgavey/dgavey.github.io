"Lee" is the real-life story of famous war photographer Lee Miller. Kate Winslet delivers a stellar performance in this wartime drama about Lee Miller's life. Andy Samberg also delivered a great performance in his role as David. It was refreshing to see him outside of his normal comedic roles.

I became interested in Lee Miller and her life after watching "Civil War" earlier this year. The main character in that movie was also a a war correspondent and was named after Lee Miller.

This is an excellent drama about the horrors of war and a woman pushing the boundaries of what was allowed at the time. I'm fairly certain it will collect some Oscar nominations this year.
