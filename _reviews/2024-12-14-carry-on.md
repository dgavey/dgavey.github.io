"Carry-on" is a new Christmas movie that is trying to be the Die Hard of the current generation. 

Although it was a fun action movie with a somewhat unique premise, it misses overall for me. It was a bit too much action and not enough reasons for the action. Although this is a decidedly watchable movie, it's equally forgettable. 

Fine for an evening, not good enough for a generation.
