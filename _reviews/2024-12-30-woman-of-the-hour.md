"Woman of the Hour" is a movie about the real-life serial killer [Rodney Alcala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Alcala) (AKA the Dating Game Killer) set in the 1970s.

Directed by and starring Anna Kendrick, this film offers a focused glimpse into the killer's life and victims. The movie maintains a consistent level of tension throughout and is quite engaging. Coming in at around 90 minutes, it never drags and keeps viewers on the edge of their seatâ€”albeit in a subtle, quietly gripping manner.

An enjoyable crime thriller overall.
