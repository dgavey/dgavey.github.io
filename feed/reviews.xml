<p>This film festival darling is one we’ve been wanting to watch for a while, and it was worth the wait. The basic plot is that a NYC sex worker gets swept off her feet by the son of a Russian oligarch. It’s probably better if you don’t know more than that going into it. The movie was a lot funnier than I expected, and the ending wasn’t quite what I anticipated, but I appreciated where they went with it.</p>

<p>A really great indie film that deserves all the attention it’s getting.</p>]]></content><author><name>Derek Gavey</name></author><category term="review" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anora is a modern-day Cinderella story, but with a few twists.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">It Ends With Us</title><link href="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2025/ends-us/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="It Ends With Us" /><published>2025-01-04T19:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-04T19:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gavey.ca/reviews/2025/ends-us</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2025/ends-us/"><![CDATA[<p>“It Ends With Us” is a story about a woman in an abusive relationship and the cycle of abuse.</p>

<p>Based on a Colleen Hoover novel, this movie stars Blake Lively. There has been controversy surrounding the film since its release, with several ongoing lawsuits casting shadows over both the stars and director. While the film was adequate, it struggled to tell a realistic story and glossed over the darker aspects of this societal issue. That being said, several of the supporting characters were exceptionally well-acted, particularly those who played the younger versions of the main characters.</p>

<p>Overall this movie was entertaining, but I was hoping for something more from it than what I got.</p>]]></content><author><name>Derek Gavey</name></author><category term="review" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“It Ends With Us” is a story about a woman in an abusive relationship and the cycle of abuse.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Way Back</title><link href="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/way-back/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Way Back" /><published>2024-12-30T19:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-30T19:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/way-back</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/way-back/"><![CDATA[<p>“The Way Back” (2011) tells the story of a group of people who walked out of a Siberian gulag to freedom.</p>

<p>Based on real events and a book whose authenticity is somewhat in question, this was a great film to watch. The makeup in particular was incredible. As usual, Colin Farrell and Ed Harris were great to watch, but also a surprise appearance by a very young Saoirse Ronan was very well acted.</p>

<p>Although overlooked by me at the time, glad I had a chance to watch it 13 years later.</p>]]></content><author><name>Derek Gavey</name></author><category term="review" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“The Way Back” (2011) tells the story of a group of people who walked out of a Siberian gulag to freedom.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Shrinking Season 2</title><link href="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/shrinking/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Shrinking Season 2" /><published>2024-12-29T19:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-29T19:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/shrinking</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/shrinking/"><![CDATA[<p>“Shrinking” Season 2 on Apple TV+ continues this great series with notable changes.</p>

<p>Shrinking is probably my current favorite series on television. Season 2 reminded me how much I loved it.
This season emphasized developing many of the secondary characters, which has kept it fresh.
Although the season finale relied on a bit too much sentimentality, it was overall a great season.</p>

<p>Very much looking forward to seeing what they do with Season 3.</p>]]></content><author><name>Derek Gavey</name></author><category term="review" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Shrinking” Season 2 on Apple TV+ continues this great series with notable changes.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Outrun</title><link href="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/outrun/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Outrun" /><published>2024-12-29T19:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-29T19:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/outrun</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/outrun/"><![CDATA[<p>“The Outrun” starring Saoirse Ronan is the story of a person struggling with alcoholism and finding themselves again back home.</p>

<p>This sad and beautiful movie is set mostly in the Orkney islands off Scotland, where stunning cinematography and natural landscapes provide a backdrop for slowly revealing the main character’s backstory. Though artfully paced, Saoirse’s stunning performance ensures it never feels dull.</p>

<p>Starring Peter Dinklage and Shirley MacLaine, this movie is a delight. The pacing is excellent, and the story remains engaging throughout. The quotes at the beginning of each chapter of the professor’s writing add a thoughtful layer to the narrative. Even the minor characters are well-developed and memorable.</p>

<p>Although it was a fun action movie with a somewhat unique premise, it misses overall for me. It was a bit too much action and not enough reasons for the action. Although this is a decidedly watchable movie, it’s equally forgettable.</p>

<p>Rewatching this as it’s been years since I’ve seen it. It still stands up all these years later. I had forgotten about “Jimmy” the raven, who in my opinion steals the show.</p>

<p>This 2013 film starring Amanda Seyfried was surprisingly good, given that the reviews on this movie were quite terrible. The acting was particularly good from both Amanda and her co-star Peter Skarsgård. Sharon Stone as the mother was unrecognizable and also delivered a great performance. The writers used an interesting technique of replaying similar scenes from different perspectives after you learn new information. The sexual content wasn’t too explicit given the context of the movie, which I thought was a good choice.</p>

<p>Quite a good movie overall.</p>]]></content><author><name>Derek Gavey</name></author><category term="review" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Lovelace” is a biopic about the first porn superstar Linda Lovelace, based on her memoirs.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Family Stone</title><link href="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/family-stone/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Family Stone" /><published>2024-12-07T19:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-07T19:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/family-stone</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/family-stone/"><![CDATA[<p>“The Family Stone” is a movie about a family in crisis set during Christmas.</p>
