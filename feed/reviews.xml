<p>Shrinking is probably my current favorite series on television. Season 2 reminded me how much I loved it.
This season emphasized developing many of the secondary characters, which has kept it fresh.
Although the season finale relied on a bit too much sentimentality, it was overall a great season.</p>

<p>Very much looking forward to seeing what they do with Season 3.</p>]]></content><author><name>Derek Gavey</name></author><category term="review" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Shrinking” Season 2 on Apple TV+ continues this great series with notable changes.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Outrun</title><link href="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/outrun/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Outrun" /><published>2024-12-29T19:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-29T19:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/outrun</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/outrun/"><![CDATA[<p>“The Outrun” starring Saoirse Ronan is the story of a person struggling with alcoholism and finding themselves again back home.</p>

<p>This sad and beautiful movie is set mostly in the Orkney islands off Scotland, where stunning cinematography and natural landscapes provide a backdrop for slowly revealing the main character’s backstory. Though artfully paced, Saoirse’s stunning performance ensures it never feels dull.</p>

<p>Highly recommend for anyone interested in film festival-style movies.</p>]]></content><author><name>Derek Gavey</name></author><category term="review" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“The Outrun” starring Saoirse Ronan is the story of a person struggling with alcoholism and finding themselves again back home.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">American Dreamer</title><link href="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/american-dreamer/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="American Dreamer" /><published>2024-12-22T19:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-22T19:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/american-dreamer</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/american-dreamer/"><![CDATA[<p>“American Dreamer” follows a disillusioned college professor pursuing the American Dream of owning a large house, only to get something unexpected instead.</p>

<p>Starring Peter Dinklage and Shirley MacLaine, this movie is a delight. The pacing is excellent, and the story remains engaging throughout. The quotes at the beginning of each chapter of the professor’s writing add a thoughtful layer to the narrative. Even the minor characters are well-developed and memorable.</p>

<p>This film deserves much wider recognition.</p>]]></content><author><name>Derek Gavey</name></author><category term="review" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“American Dreamer” follows a disillusioned college professor pursuing the American Dream of owning a large house, only to get something unexpected instead.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Carry-on</title><link href="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/carry-on/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Carry-on" /><published>2024-12-14T19:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-14T19:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/carry-on</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/carry-on/"><![CDATA[<p>“Carry-on” is a new Christmas movie that is trying to be the Die Hard of the current generation.</p>

<p>Although it was a fun action movie with a somewhat unique premise, it misses overall for me. It was a bit too much action and not enough reasons for the action. Although this is a decidedly watchable movie, it’s equally forgettable.</p>

<p>Rewatching this as it’s been years since I’ve seen it. It still stands up all these years later. I had forgotten about “Jimmy” the raven, who in my opinion steals the show.</p>

<p>This 2013 film starring Amanda Seyfried was surprisingly good, given that the reviews on this movie were quite terrible. The acting was particularly good from both Amanda and her co-star Peter Skarsgård. Sharon Stone as the mother was unrecognizable and also delivered a great performance. The writers used an interesting technique of replaying similar scenes from different perspectives after you learn new information. The sexual content wasn’t too explicit given the context of the movie, which I thought was a good choice.</p>

<p>Quite a good movie overall.</p>]]></content><author><name>Derek Gavey</name></author><category term="review" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Lovelace” is a biopic about the first porn superstar Linda Lovelace, based on her memoirs.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Family Stone</title><link href="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/family-stone/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Family Stone" /><published>2024-12-07T19:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-07T19:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/family-stone</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gavey.ca/reviews/2024/family-stone/"><![CDATA[<p>“The Family Stone” is a movie about a family in crisis set during Christmas.</p>

<p>Directed by and starring Anna Kendrick, this film offers a focused glimpse into the killer’s life and victims. The movie maintains a consistent level of tension throughout and is quite engaging.

<p>Based on a true story, it follows a massage therapist’s transformation into an international arms dealer during the early 2000s and Gulf War era.</p>

<p>Though billed as a dark comedy, I found the movie was more drama than comedy—and not particularly dark. It manages to be quite funny when it wants to be, even inspiring catchphrases like “fifty-fifty.”</p>

<p>Ultimately a story of a mother and her son separated during the Blitz, the film does a good job of exposing social issues of the era. I learned several things about that time in history I wasn’t aware of.</p>

<p>The film is solid but not exceptional. It made some odd choices with visuals and audio that were supposed to be artistic, but they felt more like distractions.</p>

<p>Saoirse, as usual, was engaging to watch, though most of the supporting actors didn’t have a chance to tell their stories. It felt in the end like there was missing content.</p>]]></content><author><name>Derek Gavey</name></author><category term="review" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Blitz” is a movie on Apple TV+ starring Saoirse Ronan about a group of Londoners during WWII.]]></summary></entry></feed>
