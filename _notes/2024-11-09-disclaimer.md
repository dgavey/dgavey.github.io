We watched "Disclaimer," starring Cate Blanchett, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Kevin Kline on Apple TV+. 

While this series is considered a thriller, its pacing is quite slow compared to most in the genre. I felt it might have worked better as a feature film. Nevertheless, the ending was worth the wait. I found myself questioning the characters' actions and my own perceptions of them after the truth was revealed. The show ultimately explores how perceptions can shift when hidden information comes to light.

 Overall, it's excellent filmmaking, and Apple TV+ continues to deliver one fantastic show after another.
