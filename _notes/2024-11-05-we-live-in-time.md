Watched this show in the theater with my girls (wife and daughter).

A lovely movie about a couple's relationship. Both Andrew and Florence's acting was particularly good. The movie jumped around to different times a lot (hence the name), which could be hard to follow. The filmmakers used some clever cues to hint to the audience when scenes and times changed. The editing and cinematography was also excellent.

Given this style of movie, they did a good job of not falling into tired tropes. It also wasn't as sad as it could have been given the subject matter. 

Overall a very enjoyable movie.
