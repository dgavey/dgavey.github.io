Apparently there is some electron app building alternatives.  

Someone alerted me to this new project called [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/). 

Looks like an interesting project if you want to build desktop apps with JS/HTML. Looks like the foot print of the app would be smaller with this.

Seems to be a Rust based project too.
